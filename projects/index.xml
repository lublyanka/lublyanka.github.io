      <description>Overview In the past, I came across an article discussing the &amp;ldquo;Goltis1 Scheme&amp;rdquo;, a method to achieve a quicker suntan without experiencing sunburns. Over time, I often thought about how beneficial it would be to have more than just an image of this scheme. An interactive application or similar tool would enhance the experience and make it easier to understand and apply the technique effectively.
