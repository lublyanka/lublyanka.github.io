  &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;h-anchor&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I came across an article discussing the &amp;ldquo;Goltis&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Scheme&amp;rdquo;, a method to achieve a quicker suntan without experiencing sunburns. Over time, I often thought about how beneficial it would be to have more than just an image of this scheme. An interactive application or similar tool would enhance the experience and make it easier to understand and apply the technique effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;also known as Vladimir Vuksta&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So after finishing another course, and still having some free time, I thought now is the time to finally do something about this scheme. And so I did.
<a href="https://github.com/lublyanka/sun_tan_bot">https://github.com/lublyanka/sun_tan_bot</a></p>
<p>In this small project, I decided to create a Telegram bot instead of a standalone application. Using a Telegram bot seemed more convenient, as many of us already use the messaging app while spending time on the beach. Instead of installing something new on your phone, you can simply interact with the bot and get the information you need. This way, you can seamlessly integrate the suntan tips into your beach chat sessions and enjoy the sun responsibly.
It has support of three locale (ES, EN and RU)</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Energy and Enthusiasm&lt;/strong&gt;: Just like a cockatoo&amp;rsquo;s energetic and enthusiastic demeanor, Scrum Management is known for its high energy and enthusiasm. Scrum teams are motivated and committed to delivering value in each sprint, fostering a positive and vibrant work atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

Similarly, Scrum Management encourages teams to continuously learn, adapt, and overcome challenges, making it a flexible and intelligent project management approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scrum Management can be compared to a cockatoo due to its vibrant and dynamic nature, mirroring the characteristics of this colorful bird.</p>
<p><strong>High Energy and Enthusiasm</strong>: Just like a cockatoo&rsquo;s energetic and enthusiastic demeanor, Scrum Management is known for its high energy and enthusiasm. Scrum teams are motivated and committed to delivering value in each sprint, fostering a positive and vibrant work atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent and Adaptive</strong>: Cockatoos are highly intelligent birds known for their problem-solving abilities and adaptability. Similarly, Scrum Management encourages teams to continuously learn, adapt, and overcome challenges, making it a flexible and intelligent project management approach.</p>
<p><strong>Social and Collaborative</strong>: Cockatoos are social birds that thrive in group settings, and likewise, Scrum Management emphasizes collaboration and effective teamwork. Scrum teams work closely together, fostering open communication and mutual support to achieve shared goals.</p>
<p><strong>Expressive Communication</strong>: Cockatoos are known for their expressive communication, using vocalizations and body language to convey their feelings. In Scrum Management, effective communication is vital, with regular ceremonies like Daily Standups and Sprint Reviews facilitating open and transparent communication among team members.</p>
<p><strong>Adorned with Colors</strong>: Cockatoos boast vibrant and stunning plumage, much like the colorful array of practices and tools in Scrum Management. Scrum ceremonies, artifacts, and roles add richness to the project management process, creating a visually appealing and efficient workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Curiosity and Exploration</strong>: Cockatoos are curious creatures, exploring their surroundings with an inquisitive nature. Similarly, Scrum Management encourages teams to inspect and adapt regularly, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Attention-Grabbing Performances</strong>: Cockatoos are known for their entertaining displays and attention-grabbing performances. In Scrum Management, the Sprint Review provides an opportunity for teams to showcase their achievements and receive feedback, similar to a captivating cockatoo performance.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Bonds and Loyalty</strong>: Cockatoos form strong bonds with their flock members and exhibit loyalty to their group. In Scrum Management, the collaboration and commitment among team members create a sense of camaraderie and dedication to achieving project success together.</p>
<p>By drawing parallels between Scrum Management and a cockatoo, we can appreciate the liveliness, intelligence, and social dynamics that make Scrum an effective and engaging project management framework. Just as cockatoos bring color and life to their surroundings, Scrum Management brings agility and efficiency to project teams, leading to successful and value-driven product development.</p>
