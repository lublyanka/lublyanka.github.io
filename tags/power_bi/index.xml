      <description>IBM SkillsBuild PowerBI program is a certification program offered by IBM in collaboration with Udemy and SkillsBuild.
The 8-weeks program consists of a series of courses covering various parts of reports in PowerBI:
 Microsoft Power BI - Power BI Desktop Course(24h) People Analytics with Power BI (5h) Supply chain (2.5h) Final Project (20h)  Apart from being a completely new subject for me, I also faced the additional challenge of taking the course entirely in Spanish as part of the Datahack scholarship program.</description>
